# 💼 Expense Tracker - CBSE Grade XII Project

## 📚 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Expense Tracker**, a project built as part of my CBSE Grade XII Computer Science curriculum.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple navigation with an intuitive menu system.
- **Expense Categorization**: Organize expenses into predefined categories like Food, Transport, Housing, Health, Leisure, and Others.
- **Detailed Tracking**: Attach custom notes to transactions, ensuring every expense is accounted for.
- **Reports**: Generate monthly reports with visual charts to help analyze spending habits.
- **Data Persistence**: All user data is stored in CSV files for easy access and storage.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

This project was built using the following Python modules:
- `csv` for managing data storage in CSV format.
- `os` and `ast` for managing file operations and string manipulation.
- `datetime` for working with dates and formatting transactions.
- `matplotlib` for generating visual reports in the form of bar charts.
- `rich` for creating a visually appealing command-line interface with rich text, tables, and panels.

## 🎯 Learning Experience

This project was not just a fun exercise but also a significant learning experience in Python development. I gained in-depth knowledge about:
- **File Handling**: Working with CSV files allowed me to understand how to store and retrieve structured data efficiently.
- **Data Representation**: Leveraging Python’s built-in libraries to manipulate data formats like strings and dictionaries was an essential part of this project.
- **Visualization**: Using `matplotlib` to create dynamic charts made me realize the power of data visualization in understanding patterns.
- **Command-Line Interfaces**: Implementing a clean, user-friendly CLI using `rich` helped me polish my skills in Python's terminal interface design.

## 📊 Usage

1. **Login or Create an Account**: Users can create a new account or log in with their existing credentials.
2. **Add an Expense**: Users can enter expenses by specifying the amount, category, and adding custom notes for reference.
3. **View Expenses**: The app allows users to view all their expenses or filter them by category.
4. **Generate Reports**: Users can generate monthly reports in both tabular and graphical form.
5. **Visual Charts**: Users can choose to visualize their expense data with bar charts to see a clearer breakdown.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Working on this Expense Tracker project has tremendously improved my Python skills, particularly in the areas of file handling, CSV manipulation, and data visualization. It was a fun and rewarding project that allowed me to apply my programming knowledge in a practical, real-world scenario.
